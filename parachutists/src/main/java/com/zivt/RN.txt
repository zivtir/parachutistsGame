1. Initiate the images repository from start() of GameManager (not from the constructor of ImageRepository)
2. Create the Timer in start() of GameManager, so GamaManager is not ActionListener.
3. Remove the logic of accumulateScore and setLives from MainPanel, so it can be handle by any new logic.
4. Add 2 level abstraction for Observers and listeners
5. support multi listeners
6. single resposibility of repository, maimPanel,
